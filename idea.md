**Your Main Concerns (Restated):**

* You want a **step-by-step Go project** that:

  * Strengthens your Go skills for a Python-based distributed system role at **datma**.
  * Relates to **healthcare multimodal data pipelines**.
  * Demonstrates concurrency, distributed design, and basic bioinformatics handling (if possible).
* You want a project that fits into your technical prep (Python/Go mix, backend, APIs, data processing).
* You want clear, actionable steps‚Äîpreferably something that could double as a portfolio demo or a talking point for interviews.

---

**Clarification Needed:**

* **What level of Go experience do you have right now?** (Complete beginner, know basics, written a few scripts, etc.)
* **What timeline do you have before the interview?** (1 week, 2 weeks, a month?)

## üèóÔ∏è *Step-by-Step Go Project*: **Distributed Mini Data Harmonizer (Python + Go)**

**Project Goal:**
Build a **mini distributed data harmonization pipeline** for healthcare data. The Python backend orchestrates, while Go handles a CPU-bound, parallelizable ‚Äúharmonization‚Äù job (e.g., CSV cleaning, file conversion, lightweight ETL). *Optional: Plug in a stub for R later.*

### **Project Overview:**

* **Python:** Orchestrator, REST API, task queue (e.g., Celery/RQ/just threads for demo)
* **Go:** Worker that receives jobs (via HTTP or gRPC), processes data, returns results
* **Database:** SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing job metadata/results
* **Demo Dataset:** Mock EHR (electronic health record) CSV/JSON files
* **Bonus:** Simple web UI (optional)

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **Step 1: Define the Problem & Set Up Mock Data**

* Create a few sample CSVs: mock patient data, lab results, imaging metadata.
* Example: `patients.csv`, `labs.csv`, `imaging.csv`

#### **Step 2: Go Fundamentals Refresher**

* Quick review of Go: structs, error handling, HTTP server, goroutines, channels.

  * **Resource:** [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

#### **Step 3: Build the Go Worker Service**

* **Input:** Receives a file (via HTTP POST or gRPC)
* **Task:** "Harmonizes" (cleans, transforms, or validates) the file. For demo, maybe:

  * Remove duplicates
  * Standardize field names
  * Simple checksums/validation
* **Concurrency:** Use goroutines to process multiple files in parallel.
* **Output:** Returns a cleaned file or result JSON.

#### **Step 4: Build a Python Orchestrator**

* Simple Flask/FastAPI service
* API endpoint to:

  * Accept a file upload (or pick from local directory)
  * Queue up a harmonization task
  * Dispatch task to Go service (HTTP call)
  * Store job metadata/result in DB
* (Optional: Use Celery/RQ for async queue)

#### **Step 5: Integrate and Test the Pipeline**

* From Python, upload/test a batch of files.
* Show logs: job in queue ‚Üí Go processes ‚Üí result saved.

#### **Step 6: Add Basic Observability**

* Add simple logging/metrics (log job duration, errors).
* (Optional: Export to Prometheus or pushgateway if you want to show observability basics.)

#### **Step 7: Document & Polish**

* Clear README: system design, ‚Äúwhat you learned‚Äù, code structure.
* Add diagrams (simple block diagrams with [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net/) or Markdown ASCII).
* Prepare a short ‚Äúwalkthrough‚Äù for interviews.

### **Actionable Milestones**

1. **Day 1:**

   * Set up Go dev env; review Go basics; create mock data.

2. **Day 2:**

   * Build basic Go HTTP server to accept and ‚Äúharmonize‚Äù a file (demo on local machine).
   * Implement concurrency: process two files at once.

3. **Day 3:**

   * Build Python orchestrator: upload/dispatch files to Go worker; save results to DB.

4. **Day 4:**

   * Integrate, test pipeline end-to-end; add error handling/logging.

5. **Day 5+:**

   * Polish docs, add diagrams, optional UI or observability.

---

### **Variations / Alternatives**

* **No DB?** Just return processed data directly and log to file.
* **More Complex?** Add batch processing, result notifications, or R worker stub.
* **Bioinformatics Angle?** Add simple FASTA/VCF file harmonization in Go (use [biogo](https://github.com/biogo/biogo)).

---

### **Interview Talking Points You Gain**

* *‚ÄúI built a Python-Go distributed pipeline with real concurrency, error handling, and healthcare data cleaning. The Go worker was chosen for its speed and concurrency primitives, while Python orchestrated and provided API endpoints. I can demo or walk through the design.‚Äù*
* You‚Äôll be able to discuss:

  * **Go concurrency** (goroutines, channels)
  * **Inter-language orchestration**
  * **REST APIs and backend design**
  * **Simple distributed system concepts (queue, workers, observability)**
